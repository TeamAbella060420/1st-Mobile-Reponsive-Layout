          <p> Reading not only improves my communication or reading skills but also improves my personality. 
              Reading makes me understand the importance of self-belief, improves my life quality and makes me a better person, 
              not only this, reading makes me look more attractive and sexy as well. Reading transform my journey from unknown to known.

          <h2 >Listening to Music</h2>
          <p>I listen to many genres.
               The genres that I listen to the most is R&B. I listen to R&B because it relates to my life. 
               R&B is one of the tops ten genres listened to. Music to me is like a teacher reading a book. Music is just that good.                       
               I wake up listening to music. Music is my passion. While I am writing this, I am listening to music.
               I cannot help myself. Some people are addicted to drugs and alchohol but music is my addiction.
          </p>
          <p>Music has many different meaning to it. In order for me to understand a song, I have to listen
              to the song over and over again. If someone gave me a quiz on music, I would most likely pass
              the pop quiz.

          <h2>Gardening</h2>
              <p>Amidst the problems with climate change and the food shortage in some part of the world,
                  certain hobbies may become beneficial to humankind. In my personal attempt to help in 
                  alleviating this environmental dillema, I recently engaged myself in a hobby that is useful
                  for myself and to the environment. Gardening is a hobby that I am quite interested in. 
                  This hobby is important to me as I am trying to go organic and help the environment in my own
                  little way.
              </p>
              <p>Gardening may look easy at the start but tending the garden is actually a task that
                  needs knowledge in plants and soil composition. I am moving towards in creating an organic 
                  garden that I find beneficial, since I can grow food in my backyard. However, I need to 
                  know what plants are best to plant in a particular season.
